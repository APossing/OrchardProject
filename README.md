A complex chemical inventory system by Adam Possing

To tour what works so far:

- Changing language to Spanish in settings

1.Go to Add order
  - Add an item in the dropdown
  - write in a quantity
  - use smart dropdowns to allocate where the product will go
  - add to order
  - type in order name
  (maybe add a few orders)
  - Then submit
  (print is not currently working as DB has changed, but it would generate a excel doc)
- The orders are now stored
Repeat step 1 again to see additional functionality later
2. Go to order manager and click around in it, the 2 elements are communicating using events

Thats all for now, the rest is coming soon.
